## 🔍 What Are Autoencoders?

Autoencoders are a type of deep learning model used for **unsupervised learning**. They learn to compress data (encoding) and then reconstruct it (decoding), capturing essential features in the process.

### 🧩 Core Components

- **Encoder**: Compresses input into a low-dimensional representation.
- **Latent Space / Bottleneck**: Encoded compact summary of the input.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input from the encoded representation.

> 📌 Note: Input and output dimensions are typically the same. The internal layers (encoder, bottleneck, decoder) can be varied.

### 🚀 Real-World Applications

- ✨ Transformers & BigBird: For text summarization and generation.
- 🖼️ Image Compression: Efficient storage without losing key features.
- 📊 PCA Alternative: Flexible, nonlinear substitute for Principal Component Analysis.

## 🧼 Image Denoising with Convolutional Autoencoders

This project demonstrates how to build a **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)** to remove noise from images while preserving structure and clarity.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Train a model that can remove **Gaussian noise** from images using deep convolutional neural networks.

### 📁 Dataset

A custom dataset of clean images with artificially added **random Gaussian noise**.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### 🧠 Encoder
- `Conv2D` → `ReLU` → `MaxPooling2D`
- `Conv2D` → `ReLU` → `MaxPooling2D`

> ✅ ReLU activation combats vanishing gradients.

### 🛠️ Decoder
- `Conv2DTranspose` → `ReLU` → `UpSampling2D`
- `Conv2DTranspose` → `Sigmoid`

## 📉 Optimization

- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a variable learning rate

---

## 🧪 Challenges & Solutions

### ⚠️ Overfitting
- Mitigated with **Dropout layers** and **Data Augmentation** (e.g., flips, rotations)

### ⚙️ Loss Function Tuning
- Tested MSE vs. L1 loss → MSE gave better image fidelity.

### 🧠 Model Complexity
- Balanced depth of convolution layers to avoid underfitting or excessive training time/memory usage.

## 🎨 Result

The final model effectively removed noise, preserving structural integrity of input images and producing **visually enhanced outputs**.
